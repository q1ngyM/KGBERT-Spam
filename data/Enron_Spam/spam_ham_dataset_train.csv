subject california energy crisis california s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues what happened in california the source of california s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand california s economy grew percent since this increased the demand for electricity by percent at the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added the result predictably is a shortage this summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state in addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis first the state s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility in california state regulation prevented this strategy this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price second retail markets were not deregulated regulated retail rates remained in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate they are now nearly bankrupt in short california s problems were caused by regulation not deregulation regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices at the time california was developing its restructuring plan enron warned the state s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives which if adopted would have averted the current crisis enron s role many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem power sellers including enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media here are the facts other than a small amount of wind power enron is not a generator in the state of california every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers as a seller to end use markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face we protected and still protect our customers from price volatility you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market early reports mischaracterized this as a enron continues to sign up customers in the state and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets enron s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs there has never been more demand for our products and services the solution the solution to california s crisis is also straightforward in summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state s utilities increasing supply california s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year in california it often takes to years california simply must streamline this process ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much nox california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities reducing demand customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is an open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today california should fully open its retail market reducing reliance on the spot market in a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixed price basis the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk restoring the financial integrity of the state s institutions the utilities in california are not paying their bills this has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse price caps have been proposed they don t work have never worked and they will not work here price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california there is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education roads and other public goods which the private sector cannot do as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the

subject northern natural gas yesterday enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron s right to repurchase until june we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy while we would like to keep northern natural we still have some miles of safe profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our billion damage claim against dynegy it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services ken dear ets colleague on thursday enron entered into a settlement over dynegy s exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy in this respect enron corp has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas consequently enron corp has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved the company has concluded that with this settlement enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court for the northern natural gas employees i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day to day satisfaction of running a valuable successful business beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas over many years we have run high quality cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets keep up the good work stan,0

validation group it gives them the ability to change counterparties names after bridge back impact to logistics unify if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge backed it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place one problem may be with the imbalance data sets which are not in production yet edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities especially where nominations were sent for entire month can t remember the rules on this one but i think unify does have some safe guards idiot proofs to force re pathing unify does have the ability to over ride duns numbers yet would still cause an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response what are if any impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take place prior periods re pathing i have a call into diane and dave both after speaking w them hopefully i can get a clear understanding of the true impact i am sure we ll need to put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow

consent to assignment regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with confirmed volumes tom s words of caution if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty we created the ability for you to invalidate the deal and then change the counterparty however i did add a warning message warning changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes make sure pipeline allows this change some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback i assume for the same reasons we had this rule it used to blow up our old scheduling systems pre unify some pipelines will require a new deal and we will have to zero out the old deal before you make the change make sure the logistics person is aware just in case it causes problems with their pipeline sorry i don t know which pipes these are you will have to ask the unify team there is one rule still in place you can change from ena im east to ena im market east but not from ena im texas to hplc im hplc when changing business units they must be the same legal entity warning not the same legal entity also beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals transport capacity storage cash out once the deal is invalidated there are no rules don t forget the items were locked down for a reason if you invalidate a service deal and change the previously locked down data that was validated and someone used these deals in unify it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created using these deals will get corrupted always check with someone from unify to make sure no one

subject new version of stack manager introduction in response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide we have upgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your products this new release will be automatically installed within the next few days please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade summary of new features multiple children a child product can be the parent of another child multiple links in a chain and different types of links can be placed against a single parent static product bar prices when you change a price in the product bar and hit the or button the price stays it does not reset to the amount in product properties until you logout sorting you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on the title of the field for multiple sorts hold down your shift key parent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis relationship identified e g the product bar might before have said basis link parent and now would say stand alone parent detailed feature descriptions multiple children the new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together in a long chain for example child product a can be linked to parent product b which is in turn linked to parent product c warning although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a chain system performance is degraded by large chains this is because when a customer attempts a transaction the database must lock each and every product in the chain before it can process the transaction request the database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the locks vertical chains multiple parents and children in one long link are much slower to process than flat chains one parent with many children large vertical chains should be avoided related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the same parent for example child product a can have a basis link to parent product b at the same time child product c can have a syncopated basis link to the same parent product b parent b is the parent for both a syncopated basis link and a regular basis link static product bar prices the new version of enrononline provides for sticky product bar price and volume changes when you change a number on the product bar it does not reset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you have logged out this makes it easier to update prices volumes spreads or offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the or buttons one of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it reduces repeated price movements with the old version of stack manager if the price delta was too small traders would often repeatedly hit the price movement buttons each of these price changes must be communicated across the website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth this makes it harder for customers to transact with us each time they try a new price update moves the price resulting in an increased transaction failure rate entering an appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price movement button means that fewer but larger price movements are necessary improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure rate you may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices a new field for offset to last trade this allows you to update the offset for products which have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu sorting selecting the new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting functionality over the old you can now choose any field heading type location reference period etc and sort by that item you can do multiple sorts by holding down the shift key example if you select type and then location while holding the shift key you will see your products sorted first by product type and then within each product type by location in alphabetical order if you right click on the product menu you can choose from the same sort criteria plus you can select sort by web order which allows you to see your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the website note however that a customer on the website might be also seeing a number of products in addition to the ones you are managing when you select products you can drag your mouse while holding down the left mouse button as always but now you can also hold down the key while making your selections this allows you to highlight products which are not necessarily adjacent to one another parent products and f x products one of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its treatment of how parent products are displayed the old version showed the type of link associated with the parent in the product bar to the left of the main product bar update buttons above the products tabs the new version does not show the type of link this is because the new version allows for more than one type of link on each parent product some traders may notice that their products which have f x links are now identified with a stylised fx in the product list this is to enable easy identification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the parent rather than managed individually assistance as always if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality please contact the hour help desk houston london australia general feedback if you have any comments on the new functionality or suggestions for further functionality please call david forster on if you had previously suggested new functionality which didn t make it into this release rest assured that you have not been forgotten we are working hard to improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your requests into the next release of

subject cleco deals state tract meter fred or anita i just wanted to recap our discussion to be sure that we are all on the same page from my understanding the allocation for meter state tract is supplied from bryancy braumley prior to bryancy would calculate flow from certain wellheads total this volume and then send us an allocation that would show how much gas was allocated to texas general land and hpl sale from cleco at meter effective a compressor was put in and the gas from now flows through this compressor as well as the gas from meter deal sales from dewbre and is now measured at meter tivoli station for bryancy s allocation she must take the meter statement from meter and deduct meter s flow once this is done she can take that net number and do an allocation between texas general land and hpl cleco like she has done previously i believe meter is now a check meter and meter is the actual pay meter for there were two deals in place for the sale from cleco deal and per discussions with daren farmer danny conner and jennifer martinez i have been instructed to zero out the deal for and use as the correct deal number therefore fred boas and i have zeroed out the deal and placed the volume that was allocated there to deal deal was priced at ship less which was incorrect and deal is priced at ship less therefore an adjustment will generate for for the difference in price and the change in location the allocated volume for cleco did not change however i am not sure that bryancy is allocating the volume properly between texas general land and hpl cleco i have spoke to her as well as jennifer martinez and curtis funderbruk with cleco so there might be some pma s for volume differences in addition i have changed the allocation method at meter to be a callout swing effect for october and succeeding months the volume should be computed by taking meter deducting out meter then byancy should take this net number and split it between texas general land and hpl cleco the texas general land nom is currently at meter and the hpl cleco deal is at meter fred mentioned that the texas general land nom might need to be moved to meter but nothing has been decided on that yet please let me know if something i have stated is not your understanding or you need something more done on my end also let me know who is going to be doing this monthly allocation it might be beneficial to have one person doing all the points meters thanks for your help,0

subject re path manager rewrite optimization project my comments are in fuschia lisa original message from pinion richard sent wednesday october pm to pena matt cc warner john ripley brian d souza romeo rao ramesh kinsey lisa lamadrid victor sullivan mary sullivan patti heal kevin staab theresa farmer daren j jaquet tammy superty robert bussell l kathryn subject re path manager rewrite optimization project following are my comments the managers cc d might have some additional thoughts original message from pena matt sent monday october pm to pinion richard jaquet tammy superty robert pena matt cc warner john ripley brian d souza romeo rao ramesh subject path manager rewrite optimization project importance high all we re currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed going foward i would like bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers schedulers we had this approach with nomlogic and having clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely who ever you choose we would need about of their time for now later on with coordination efforts and testing it may go up to i don t see that happening for a while though the sooner we get someone to devote to this the better off we will be i expect these changes that we ll be looking into should improve performance quite a bit that being said we ve identified three items that would speed up processing the retrieval of path manager currently the path manager attempts to reuse path ids i can t think of any reason why we need to perform this extra step it runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn t find a match i know patti has mentioned this several times and i can t think of a valid reason for performing this work i talked with dave nommensen and according to him what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place from a scheduling perspective my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it if you were overpathed you d see it in the path manager either way pinion richard to restate the question for clarity in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply market and a service adds any up downstream contract information and or duns or drn override and then saves it unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted has this changed at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path activity number match for nominations texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected therefore if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify i don t think that this constant old path look up is needed kinsey lisa get rid of this the scheduling position window does anyone use this if not we ll remove the code logic that populates this window i have never seen a scheduler use this please verify pinion richard originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system autonoms so it was duplicated in unify by request it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it s use the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers lose it kinsey lisa why is this still here on the inventory pool list does anyone need to see the contarct references list again this code is called every retrieval time and doesn t appear to be used from my observations if they do need this information we could provide it but if not i d prefer to remove the functionality pinion richard this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool keep it kinsey lisa yes we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths what s the average number of paths they create at one time what about updates i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts by update i mean going to the path list and changing an upstream downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created pinion richard this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline there is no average they typically update a path with up downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however i hope this answers your question i see no change to this process at this time kinsey lisa on some pipes this function is used more than others when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible at this time i do not see a need to change this process on brokered paths do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service in other words when updating brokered arrangements we don t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated why do we do this for service is it because we have to renominate it i assume that s what it s for since we don t send brokered paths to the pipe anyway with the nomlogic implmentation two way interface we were planning on having it behave the same way as service we need this verified pinion richard we don t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path i don t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time kinsey lisa agree with richard,0

subject enron announces plans to merge with dynegy today we announced plans to merge with dynegy a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you ve worked so hard to build following are the major components of the transaction deal terms the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of dynegy shares for every enron share for example each shares of enron stock will be converted to shares of dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing chevrontexaco owns approximately percent of dynegy s outstanding common stock chevrontexaco will invest billion in dynegy immediately and an additional billion in dynegy on closing of the merger dynegy will immediately invest billion in cash in enron s northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately million shares the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year enron will have immediate access to dynegy s billion cash investment in enron s northern natural gas subsidiary management of newly formed company chuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company which will be called dynegy inc and steve bergstrom will be president and coo i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth efficient integration the make up of the integration team has not yet been determined the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter this merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers as with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible as i said in my video this is a day like no other in our company s history we considered several options but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at if you have additional questions please submit them to questions enron com we will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions if you receive any calls from the media please refer them to our media team at i ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company rather than closing doors we are opening new ones as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise including our market reach financial strength and industry experience together we will be a new merchant powerhouse and again thank you for everything you have done for enron investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available because it will contain important information investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint

subject market watch undervalued report f april top pick of the month life energy and technology holdings inc otcbb leth leth receives in financing to fund the manufacture of the environmentally friendly biosphere process system waste to energy units in the united states first unit to roll out in new orleans in early second quarter we are expecting earth shattering upcoming news leading a strong rally in leth for a company that has announced over million in sales orders in the past year and tops that record setting achievement by acquiring the equivalent of per share in cash for major worldwide expansion our readers grabbed substantial profits for our march pick ushg featured at reached in days traded as high as since the biosphere process system soaring worldwide demand leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere process system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at to tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste problem this profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean green electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste agricultural wastes forestry wastes medical wastes industrial wastes sewage sludge shale oil sour natural gas and the huge market of used tires leth profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating to mega watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid the biosphere process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide need for cost effective renewable energy sources and a corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the disposal of waste leth has secured worldwide acceptance for a revolutionary product designed to significantly impact the global waste problem while a major push for generating electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot topic due to shortages and massive power failures financing of million positions leth for astronomical sales the magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than the fact that this stock now has accessible capital equivalent to per common share in cash there are biosphere process systems presently in operation worldwide the available funding could easily be used to produce additional biospheres now factor in that the average sale price is million per biosphere we cannot even comprehend what this stock should be trading for with a potential in future sales with million shares outstanding leth stock guidance current price near term target projected high for leth s blue chip partner fortifying the system leth is an alliance partner with tetra tech inc nasdaq ttek a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental mechanical and electrical management consulting services primarily for the us government with annual sales of million tetra tech will coordinate the securing of necessary permits installation and continuous worldwide monitoring of the biosphere process system for leth tetra tech is now in the process of obtaining department of environmental quality permitting for the biosphere process in the state of louisiana this is a monumental event for leth which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in louisiana while having a parallel effect on leth stock in the form of a huge near term announcement political power fosters rapid global expansion leth has captured the profit making attention of both us and international investors by embracing a major foothold on the global waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate electricity from alternative sources this has been accomplished by successfully creating major inroads to all corners of the globe through the political contacts at the highest level from dr albert reynolds chairman of leth who is also the former prime minister of ireland dr reynolds international stature has been instrumental in guiding leth into a position of worldwide dominance in an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market uncommon value for a company of this caliber we are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the biosphere the impressive backlog of over million in sales orders and the company s very solid financial position we view this perfectly timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the company s own sales records as our top

subject fw gop action plan what you can do original message from alex fagen mailto alex fagens net sent wednesday november pm to undisclosed recipient rad stup com subject fw gop action plan what you can do original message from kenneth r pybus to sent wednesday november am subject fwd gop action plan what you can do i got this from paul sperry at worldnetdaily i don t know who joe morris is but this sounds like a plan note that this has been circulating since last thursday united republican fund of illinois chicago november from joseph a morris president to urf leaders and friends herewith is some practical advice on action that every citizen can take in the event that the florida recount confirms the election of george bush but al gore fails to concede we all know what is going on in florida and that the election hinges on the outcome i am writing you today to prepare us all for what we will have to do if what i think is going to happen actually does the recount which will be finished by p m thursday will likely show bush to be the winner once again with only a few thousand overseas ballots to be counted those ballots will be overwhelmingly for bush a minimum of and probably closer to if the count goes our way tomorrow we have won this election this is when something critical happens either gore bows out gracefully or he doesn t and i can almost guarantee he won t these are people wedded to power who will only go down kicking and screaming they will use every legal maneuver in the book to steal the election in when richard nixon had every right and reason to challenge the election results he didn t for the sake of the country expect no such noble behavior this time what will they try one bet is to find a friendly judge to throw out the florida results on a flimsy premise they are already floating this as a trial balloon in the form of the allegedly confusing ballots in palm beach county i have seen the ballots they are not confusing in the least indeed they are identical in form to the punch card ballots used in chicago and cook county illinois in this very election what is more it is just as likely that palm beach county voters who wanted to vote for bush inadvertently voted for nader all parties approved the form of ballot before the election the form of ballot issue is a mere pretext for an effort a judicial invalidation of the florida election while i hope this scenario doesn t come to pass i fear that it will and it will only have disastrous results for the country the election fight could drag on for months and actually be decided by a court if this comes to pass the vision of our founders and the blood of patriots will have been betrayed personally i am not going to stand for this and i hope you won t either the good news is that we are not without voice here is what must be done if the vote count affirms bush s election we allow a short grace period to see the reaction of the gore camp if they have not graciously conceded after a few hours we must bombard the news media and our public officials at every level with phone calls of outrage that demand gore s concession i mean literally millions of phone calls we must jam their phone banks with calls there are millions of us so it shouldn t be too difficult while you re at it send e mails to your local newspapers as well if it becomes widely reported and it will that there is a groundswell demanding that gore back down and not embarrass the country it will be very difficult for gore to withstand the pressure he will have to relent here are some places to start the white house telephone fax e mail president whitehouse gov the vice president s office telephone fax e mail vice president whitehouse gov vice president s senate office telephone senator tom

brother of gore s campaign manager bill daley telephone fax if you ve never made a call like this there s no reason to be shy they get opinion calls all the time and are set up to take them in fact

subject tenaska iv gas daren per review of the gas agreements between tenaska iv and williams apache and our understanding of the agency agreement i had a few items i wanted to discuss with you in lieu of our meeting today that was cancelled looking at the october gas supply to the plant i think tenaska iv should have been charged at the contract prices with williams apache i e and not at what the final price that was actualized per megan s summary at price of if this volume was charged at the total would have been a difference of looking at the november gas supply to the plant tenaska iv was charged per mmbtu instead of for volumes of at the price the total settlement price was instead of at showing a difference of i reviewed the gas supply agreements and the williams gas price pg for gas is which can be adjusted by the waha transportation adjustment if delivered at waha this adjustment started in at per mmbtu and increase by per year thereby currently the adjustment factor is at giving us a price of per mmbtu in reviewing the apache gas agreement pg i noticed that the gas price is at waha at katy carthage for per review of the apache invoices it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at other places i e lomak sterling mendell cdp at a price of if enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a margin difference then that is upside to enron however i think the plant should not be charged above the contract price of looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for november and october i did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from williams and apache of mmbtu per day therefore i don t think spot prices are part of the equation here additionally i recall from our meeting last month that all enron makes on this deal is the agency fee of per mmbtu excluding the margin difference that enron has on apache gas delivery points if my scenario above is correct so based upon items above i am suggesting that tenaska iv adjust their november invoice owed to enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price differences showed above therefore i am planning to wire a payment of see breakout below on friday to enron on behalf of tenaska iv texas partners ltd for this activity month plant gas price amount november november adjustment october adjustment nov agency fee sept agency fee total i discussed these issues with mike mazowita rick hill jody pierce before reaching this conclusion should you have any different ideas or thoughts that i am not covering please call me at and we can discuss thanks james,0

out companies that show promise and are in need of raising capital and require accounting and managerial assistance it is the intention of abdv to build a portfolio of companies in diverse industries vkdqkgxdjmtnnh companies under abdvyyhtxnv e direct inc knfbdcv fine wein records inc jbwfldy from actual press releases yjycunv red bank n j aug primezone via comtex the following is a letter from john figliolini president of atlantis business development corporation inc otcbb ldgkcpf dear shareholder addlrko i am writing to you today to discuss the new direction which your company will be heading up until this point we made it clear that abdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of the market our basic premise was to seek out companies that can be turned into positive cash flow businesses with the proper equity investment made into them by abdv fine wein records is an example of that with a financial commitment of by abdv we expect fine wein to be able to throw off significant positive cash flow over the next months from the various projects they are currently working on e direct is another example we should start to see some meaningful positive cash flow developing and continuing over the next months however abdv has not maintained a particular industry focus as of today that has changed wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir last week we announced that abdv will be providing in equity financing to future quest inc pink sheets a company in the oil gas sector this was the start of our new direction abdv will be dedicated in locating and provide managerial accounting and financing for companies in the energy field from oil and gas companies to alternative energy companies jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft you may ask why the energy related field simply it currently offers many opportunities and with the price of oil approaching per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth to be made in this sector according to adjusted inflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak of from the s however unlike the oil crisis of the past we are looking at what will be a problem to stay with us for a long time simply put the demand for oil world wide has increased by some this year alone most of which is because of china the increase in oil prices is not a fade which once the bubble bursts will result in oil back in the level we are looking at a trend that is now cemented in stone there are more players in the world economy today that require oil gas to propel their own economies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at these higher levels abdv has already aligned itself with individuals that have experience in the energy field these individuals will help locate viable opportunities and the funding necessary to participate in these opportunities wtxrxayfisoira so what do we do with our non energy related businesses such as fine wein records and e direct well first of all we will continue to incubate and nurture these businesses until they are at a level where they can move on their own i believe that both of these companies will be strong viable businesses in months from now at that point i will recommend to abdv s board of directors that we spin off these two businesses to our shareholders this strategy is in keeping with the basic premise of our business module whereby we share the wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing public our portfolio companies we can then continue to concentrate in the energy related field lvxhkmblmcewrw by concentrating on a specific sector such as the energy area we will be able to define abdv s purpose and guide it like a laser our goal will be to locate and make investments in no less than four energy related businesses over the next months i believe that by maintaining this focus an investment in abdv will be looked at as an innovative way to participate in the booming oil gas and energy related fields twqssqlqqkvbdm fine wein records inc announces compilation music

combining the lrc and bridgeline pipeline systems summary the lrc bridgeline pipeline systems will be combined under the name of bridgeline llc ownership in the jv will be split texaco enron bridgeline gas marketing llc will be the entity that will be trading on the pipelines under the new j v contracts and service agreements are in the process of being drafted enron will be providing the trading and commercial operations systems to support this j v texaco will be providing the scada system i understand that accounting is still being discussed the trading risk perhaps scheduling personnel for this jv will be initially relocated to the st floor of the enron building and will eventually move to probably the allen center once a more permanent spot can be built out trading for the new jv will start in early february for march production to do s accounting i ve asked jim coffey to set up two work orders to capture it transition and ongoing costs texaco is also trying to set up a meeting next monday to step through the accounting flow so that we are all on the same page and make sure there is nothing that will fall through the cracks pc s jim fussell is in the process of ordering the pc s for this jv at my request i will need the work order numbers to track these costs networks i m coordinating with arshak and his team to make sure that the voice and data networks are in place for eb once the more permanent spot is nailed down we will then need to do the same for that location a combination of trader phones lucent phones stenfons and amtels have been requested location on eb i m waiting on a call back from chris larson from facilities to find out what locations on will be assigned to the new jv currently half of the floor is empty but they are set up with high wall cubes there may need to be some build out for the traders to low wall cubes we can t set up the pc s phones amtels etc until this is done data conversion i have requested from texaco the contract deal and meter facility information we will need to set up in our systems to begin trading for march production it may be possible to get an electronic dump of this data from texaco if enron defines the data fields that we will need we also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios i will also need to know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up the system security i have received the names of the traders but i don t know who else will need access interface between enron s unify pop s application and bridgeline s scada application i ve asked dave nommensen from enron to get with carryn wright from texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the two applications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface there will also need to be a transition plan put in place where lrc s rtu s efm is redirected to the bridgeline scada system in the meantime there will be two scada systems and perhaps two gas controls until everything is merged into one this will probably mean some manual interfaces between pop s and scada for confirmed noms and efm volumes until the transition is complete scada communications currently the lrc rtu s efm communicate back to enron s scada system via leased lines bridgelines rtu s communicate back to them via a microwave system the new jv could save on communications costs by switching lrc s rtu communication to the microwave perhaps this is best done as a part of the scada transition accounting data needed by texaco for royalty purposes this data needs to be better defined i will follow up with john ledoux from texaco to get this process started hourly volumes bridgeline currently has one utility customer who may be billed on an hourly basis depending on the amount of swing we need to talk through this process to see what enhancements may be needed at least initially there will need to be some manual processes in place to support the billing for this one customer please let me know if you d like to meet on any of these topics i can have my assistant set up the meeting if needed in the mean time i can be reached at thanks tommy,0

unproved prospects bnp petroleum s initial development strategy has been to acquire such proven fields and increase production through the application of advanced technology and the exploration of other proven formations in the same fields bnp petroleum corporation s primary operational strategy includes the operation of its own projects giving it substantial control over drilling and production costs the company has associated with highly experienced exploration and development engineering and geology personnel that strive to add production at lower costs through development drilling workovers behind pipe recompletions and secondary recovery operations the company s long term strategy is to build an oil and gas production company through a strategic combination of

subject jump in to gain substantial ground immediately we are very excited about this new upcoming stock about to explode montana oil and gas inc mogi to explore further opportunities in alberta canada is an energy deveioper in canada s most highiy coveted reservoirs aggressive investors and traders may want to watch montana oi and gas again this morning montana oil and gas inc mogi news announces that the syivan lake oil and gas project is sti awaiting a rig at this time the surface lease has been constructed and we have been waiting for a rig to become avaiiabie for over two weeks and anticipate this to happen next week at the latest the company has a working interest in the syivan lake project symbo mogi current price reasons to consider mogi price charts confirm oi prices are experiencing the strongest bul market in a generation natura gas prices have tripled in the ast two years with multiple projects in high gear and the expanding production on reserves potentialiy worth muiti millions mogi is seliing for less than the vaiue of its assets montana oi and gas specializes in using new technology to turn unproductive oi and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises aiready shares in the oi and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa market in fact four of dow jones ten top performing industry sectors for the past year are energy related but it s in the mid sized explorers and deveiopers like montana oi mogi that the biggest gains are being made in the last months many of these stocks made tripie and even quadruple returns breaking news april montana oil and gas reports the following update on its sylvan lake project after several delays due to unseasonable weather and road closures in the province of alberta the contracted drilling rig was moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the w m well the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in compliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well immediately there after the company s west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion of tie in upon lifting of the road ban with the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and gas has prepared a detailed project description project history the sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late s and has produced over million barrels mbbls of high quality crude oil and billion cubic feet bcf of associated natural gas predominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations the field remains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and expanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics the original freehold lease on section w m was leased to a major oil company as was most of the sylvan lake field itself an exploratory well was drilled by this major company in w m in and was abandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely eroded by post depositional cutting as a consequence the major company did no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the complaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the deeper mineral rights below the base of the jurassic formations on the west one half of section back to the freehold mineral rights owner in the early s this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as mineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more specifically not often by the major companies accordingly these mineral rights sat available and dormant until the early s as almost all oil and gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee through diligent land work including field visits our partners discovered this relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section since that time our partners have managed to lease an additional acres one quarter section of section energy has the right to earn of this prospect possibly with the drilling of a test well in w m land discussion our partners have secured a working interest in the west half and northeast quarter of section w m the land comprises some acres one section or one square mile equals acres primary drilling spacing in alberta is as follows one quarter section spacing acres for oil and one section spacing acres for natural gas the province allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units called holdings should you be able to prove to the province s satisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased well density almost the entire sylvan lake field pekisko pool has been down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering pekisko oil we will down space as well geological discussion pekisko formation the principle target of this prospect is oil and associated gas production from the deeper older pekisko formation the sylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the pekisko formation this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was influenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions overlying this ancient shoreline are cap rocks impermeable layers of the mississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous jurassic impermeable shales these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and account for billions of barrels of reserves production facilities discussion this immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas over the past forty five years accordingly a multitude of gas gathering and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been constructed a major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our project with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed drilling location the capacity of the processing facility is approximately mmcf d with current throughput of only mmcf d accordingly excess capacity of mmcf d exists in the facility which would be in the best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible this gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the transportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of red deer alberta accordingly trucking costs would be minimal to get oil product to the transportation system for more detailed project description please see news release dated fri apr good luck and successfu trading conclusion the examples above show the awesome earning potential of little known companies that explode onto investor s radar screens many of you are already familiar with this is mogi poised and positioned to do that for you then you may

subject bpa rate case seasonal rates forwarded by mary hain hou ect on am enron capital minnesota power and light co opinion no issued april mimeo at in both cases the commission rejected rate design features where there was no evidence in the record showing that the rate design features reflected cost incurrence id in its order setting this proceeding for hearing the commission took note of edison s proposed seasonal differential and specifically directed that the parties fully address the issues related to the cost support for the seasonal rate design commission order issued march mimeo at on october the parties were directed by the presiding judge to identify in their initial briefs the portions of the record that relate to cost support for the seasonal differential the requirement that edison provide cost support for its seasonal differential as discussed supra is also set forth in the commission s filing requirements for rate schedules if the rate design is intended to reflect costs the applicant must show how it reflects costs if the rate design is not intended to reflect costs the applicant must justify the departure from costbased rates cfr o b iii statement p edison s seasonal differential is intended to lessen the costs imposed upon it by its prominent summer peak edison reasons that since it must build capacity to meet its prominent summer peak charging more in the summer would give customers an incentive to control their summer demands and therefore edison s cost of adding capacity would be reduced tr accordingly edison must show how its seasonal differential reflects the costs imposed on it by summer demand under the commission s filing requirements in cfr o b iii statement p further even purpa section d relied upon by edison states that rates shall be on a seasonal basis which reflects the costs of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of the year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for such utility emphasis added further support for relying on marginal rather than average costs comes from the commission itself in its order of march setting this cause for hearing mimeo at the commission in commenting on time of day and seasonal rates mentioned that it encourage innovative rate design to match more closely rates to costs in this regard the commission cited its order no supra at which specifically suggests use of pricing mechanisms based on marginal cost principles for jurisdictional wholesale sales under the circumstances in this case where the sale of economy energy is related to edison s costs in adding or eliminating additional excess capacity it is appropriate to establish the price for economy transactions on marginal costs this provides a more close matching of the rate to the cost than would a rate design based on average costs accordingly winnetka s position on pricing of economy energy will not be adopted affirmed and reversed see next paragraph comm opinion order ferc commonwealth edison company docket nos er and er may turning to commonwealth s exceptions we find that the judge correctly rejected the seasonal differential even if we accept the company s interpretation of purpa it still has not cited any record evidence whatsoever of a difference in costs between summer and nonsummer months without at least some showing of a cost difference it is impossible to make a judgment on the reasonableness of the company s proposal we therefore uphold the judge on this point we reverse the judge s adoption of a price set at of the utility s incremental costs however and approve the type b split savings method proposed by commonwealth under this method economy transactions are arranged for a hour or similar period at a fixed price based on cost estimates at the time of the agreement if the utility s incremental costs rise to the point that continued supply would become burdensome the utility may terminate supply we find this method superior to that proposed by staff in that implementation is greatly simplified cost determinations need not be made as frequently related to pmas reg preamble fercsr procedures for public participation in power and transmission rate adjustments and extensions december cfr fr historically many purpa type standards have been used in designing wholesale rates for the sale of federal hydroelectric power pmas analyze costs to establish revenue requirements and consider this information in designing rates declining block rates for energy were once used by the pmas but subsequently were found inappropriate and eliminated from rate schedules many of the pmas for years have been effectively using various forms of load management measures in their rate schedules such as scheduling limitations loadshaping capacity and energy overrun charges etc bpa has had a history of using seasonal rates for wholesale firm capacity and energy and also offered its direct service industrial customers interruptible rates some time ago southwestern has had interruptible capacity rates in effect since these examples demonstrate the willingness of the pmas to implement purpa type standards where applicable many of these purpa type standards when applied appropriately in the design of pma rates can serve to implement the purposes of purpa by encouraging conservation of energy efficient use of resources and facilities and equitable rates the public participation process will provide an opportunity to examine these and other appropriate concepts the pmas will continue to review and revise their power marketing practices on a system by system basis to serve the purpa objectives the assistant secretary for resource applications working with the administrators of the power administrations and after receiving public comment will consider the adoption of rate design guidelines similar in form to the guidelines in ra on financial accounting and ratemaking which will reflect the experience gained by the pmas in their system by system approach to rate design related to purpa fed law fercsr purpa sec consideration and determination respecting certain ratemaking standards seasonal rates the rates charged by an electric utility for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall be on a seasonal basis which reflects the costs of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of the year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for such utility fed reg notice fercsr doe responsibilities under title i of purpa seasonal rates shall be established where costs vary by season prop reg preamble fercsr administrative determination of full avoided costs sales of power to qualifying facilities and inter connection facilities march docket no rm fr fr pricing flexibility may take several different forms for instance a contract could provide qfs with a price floor applicable to all the power supplied to the utility but still provide for higher variable unit prices reflecting daily or seasonal periods the price floor would provide the revenue stream necessary for the qf to secure financial support while the price variability would induce the qf to maximize deliveries in peak load periods when the utility values additional supplies most of course the price floor should not exceed the minimum value of the utility s avoided cost similarly a contract could provide for a two part price a fixed payment for capacity and an energy price for power delivered the qf would be assured a minimum revenue stream based on the value of its capacity the variable energy component would allow the utility to dispatch the qf capacity only when it was economic whatever the pattern of contract payments rates for purchases from qfs should always reflect how well the characteristics of the suppliers power match the purchasing utility s need this will ensure that the qf will make most production decisions on the basis of rates reflecting avoided costs rather than the guaranteed average rate and at the same time will receive revenues sufficient to attract investors to avoid problems such as those associated with take or pay contracts in the natural gas industry the commission wishes to stress the danger of including forecasted fuel costs in the fixed rate structure of long term contracts especially in combination with the specification of minimum purchase quantities the commission also encourages the use of time of day and seasonal rates in flexible pricing structures for long term contracts reg preamble fercsr small power production and cogeneration facilities regulations implementing section of the public utility regulatory policies act of order no february docket no rm cfr fr fr rather than specifying that exact time of day or seasonal rates for purchases are required however the commission believes that the selection of a methodology is best left to the state regulatory authorities and nonregulated electric utilities charged with the implementation of these provisions,0

subject re sitara release re changes in global due to consent to assignment fyi this change went in for the deal validation group it gives them the ability to change counterparties names after bridge back impact to logistics unify if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge backed it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place one problem may be with the imbalance data sets which are not in production yet edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities especially where nominations were sent for entire month can t remember the rules on this one but i think unify does have some safe guards idiot proofs to force re pathing unify does have the ability to over ride duns numbers yet would still cause an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response what are if any impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take place prior periods re pathing i have a call into diane and dave both after speaking w them hopefully i can get a clear understanding of the

confirmed volumes tom s words of caution if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty we created the ability for you to invalidate the deal and then change the counterparty however i did add a warning message warning changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes make sure pipeline allows this change some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback i assume for the same reasons we had this rule it used to blow up our old scheduling systems pre unify some pipelines will require a new deal and we will have to zero out the old deal before you make the change make sure the logistics person is aware just in case it causes problems with their pipeline sorry i don t know which pipes these are you will have to ask the unify team there is one rule still in place you can change from ena im east to ena im market east but not from ena im texas to hplc im hplc when changing business units they must be the same legal entity warning not the same legal entity also beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals transport capacity storage cash out once the deal is invalidated there are no rules don t forget the items were locked down for a reason if you invalidate a service deal and change the previously locked down data that was validated and someone used these deals in unify it is highly likely that the unify deals

subject organizational changes we are making a number of significant organizational changes these changes are intended to accomplish four key objectives first we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built around a relatively small strategic asset position second we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships particularly with joe sutton s departure the ability to directly manage the day to day activities of independent business units has become increasingly difficult third we need to accomplish these changes without in any way compromising the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower yielding asset positions and fourth as always we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities enron wholesale services today we are forming enron wholesale services ews which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses the closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following enhanced communication and coordination across business units more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business and more rapid extension of enron s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and markets enron wholesale services will include our current north american european including japan and australia global markets and industrial markets operations and will be expanded to include enron s net works business unit as well as a new unit enron global assets in addition enron s merchant businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this new structure as described below mark frevert currently

subject proposed rule extends marketing affiliate regulations to all affiliates ngi s daily gas price index breaking news posted sep pm proposed rule extends marketing affiliate regulations to all affiliates federal energy regulatory commissioners wednesday agreed to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking broadening the application of standards of conduct for transmission providers including both natural gas pipelines and power lines to require separation of the regulated monopolies from any other company affiliate previously the rules simply required creation of a firewall including separate operations in separate locations staffed by separate personnel between gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates the proposed rule would wall off both gas and electric transmission operations from any other affiliate gas or electric including financial affiliates the commission was presented with two options regarding the application of the proposed rule to electric transmission affiliates which still in many cases have bundled operations one option would enforce complete separation while a second would have exempted employees who deal in sales or purchases of bundled retail native load staff and commissioners wood william massey and nora brownell appeared to favor walling off all affiliated personnel so they would not be privy to market information about transmission operations that other non affiliated competitors did not have access to commissioner linda breathitt however argued for exempting personnel dealing solely with retail native load breathitt said that while she supported the eventual separation of the entities she was concerned about the timing i see no compelling reason at this time there have been no complaints and no evidence she said she thought state commissions might consider the move an infringement on their jurisdiction i agree with concept philosophically but i think there will be other opportunities later on after we do a little more bridge building with state commissions wood said he understood the political issue here with respect to federal state relations but i think this is an opportunity for discrimination that ought to be eliminated staff pointed out that if there were any problems with transmission reliability or if some small utilities had problems waivers could be granted staff was questioned by the commissioners as to how much information was available to affiliate personnel if i am an affiliate employee dealing solely with retail native load i can go into the control room and get all the information i want one staffer responded wood proposed and the commissioners ratified a proposed rule with no exceptions but which makes clear that in the final rule the commission may reverse field and determine that separation of employees dealing with sales of native load is not required commenting parties should provide cost benefit analysis on both sides of the question state commissions are also invited to comment wood had suggested the commission extend the separation to all sales employees but make it clear that if we don t hear from people that they really want this separation we ain t going to do it,0

diamond and gold properties are controlled in bolivia south america source company website currently trading at p possibilty of an absolutely huge week as massive pr campaign has started and is expected to last all week pp imagine how well your portfolio would have done the last month or so if you had the scoop on the following stock p otcbb mbah this stock closed at on september lst this little giant closed at on october th up in about weeks do you think ibm is going to move like that anytime soon p as many of you may agree some not all of these stocks move in price because they are promoted making a very large number of investors aware of the stock the awareness is underway on dmxp pp let s look at the company delta mining and exploration corp otc dmxpp about the company p delta mining and exploration corp otc dmxp is a mineral exploration company that controls properties totaling acres approximately sq miles in montana the properties are all located over what management considers to be some of the most prospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states another acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are controlled in bolivia south america initial work has revealed that the bolivian properties display similar potential to those found in north america p the management team is led by chief executive officer dr barry rayment who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration company to the next level dr rayment brings years of experience in the field of geology along with running some of the most successful mining companies in the industry dr rayment was the president of bema gold corp amex bgo a company with a market cap of close to a billion dollars he was also affiliated with glamis gold gold fields mining and amselco exploration bp minerals among others his vast experience in the mining sector along with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an extraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company moves forward p among the support team is stephen kay a geologist with more than years experience in exploration throughout europe south africa south america and the united states while with gold fields mining corp stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent drilling of the million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california p delta has experienced significant technical success since its start up in for example delta has discovered the first in situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead kimberlite southeast of lewistown the company also controls part of the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown the three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator minerals a major step toward finding the presence of economic diamonds including pyrope garnet chromite and clinoprroxene p an aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to discover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this under explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing kimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta canada p in bolivia delta controls approximately two thirds of a highly prospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia group of concessions covering acres sq miles the other one third is presently being explored by de beers in addition to the independencia property delta controls more than acres comprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays all the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further exploration is justified p delta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing its extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also by acquiring additional diamond properties delta will focus on identifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining companies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and finance additional exploration p in addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta controls they also control a gold property with great potential the property is near la paz in bolivia where initial analysis revealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an extensive exploration program pp source company website p recent headlines go online and read the full stories p delta mining and exploration corp is invited to attend a conference with the bolivian chamber of commerce p delta mining and exploration corp visits homestead property in preparation of work program p delta mining and exploration corp discloses preliminary gold exploration findings in south america p delta mining and exploration corp looks to continue diamond exploration in south america pp will dmxp explode higher as more and more investors become aware of the stock this weekend

subject the expatriate zone issue the expatriate zone issue where every day is just another shitty day in paradise the zine for the tropically impaired in this issue featured expatriate of the month james sunny jim white travel into the zone and beat the irs at the same time jimmydotcom where s that parrot head book we ve been hearing about club trini update millennium change bubba style see what all the hullabaloo online was about cabo bad boys of the expatriated phan club spotted south of the border parrothead pilots association new club in the making for the web page edition go to it includes some great pictures we suggest printing it out and laying it out on your coffee table that way you have somewhere to set your red stripe so you don t leave rings on the table welcome to the expatriate zone welcome to the first issue of the expatriate zone the official newsletter of the new expatriate zone web site after publishing the temperate zone for the past two years i m taking the opportunity to join forces with bob segel who has been publishing the coconut modem with karen coyne since april of last year after operating in aol exclusively bob created parrotkey com out on the internet where it would join it s sister site on aol and be accessible to all parrot heads at the time bob expanded pk we had been working on my little area of club st somewhere and the new parrotkey com seemed like the perfect place to open the doors of the club while we were talking about the direction we wanted to see club st somewhere and parrot key go we could see that this was the perfect chance to as emeril says kick it up a notch jimmy buffett s music was a big part of our lives but even more so was the expatriate lifestyle he sang about a lifestyle that includes tropical travel sailing boating parasailing and surfing and yes the music and lyrics of mr james w buffett so it is that we created our new web site the expatriate zone along with this newsletter of that same name in december the expatriate zone opened its doors with its island trading post with its holiday shopping service at the island trading post over people visited the site the first day and daily prizes were awarded for the first two weeks the island trading post will open again soon offering a complete line of tropical items not just to those of us that live a few blocks from wal mart but also for those of us lucky enough to be on a sailboat or living on an island for not we ll start with the t shirt of the month we want the expatriate zone to not only keep you entertained and informed while you toil away at your everyday corporate gig but it will also get you ready for that day you finally shuck it all and disappear down into the expatriate zone we hope you all enjoy our new effort and also continue to visit parrot key and club st somewhere both of which will be closely associated with the expatriate zone and parrotkey com jackson bob expatriate of the month james sunny jim white when i first ventured on the internet in i ran in to a guy named sunny jim who was living down in the cayman islands we never really got a chance to connect for which i am truly sorry but when something is supposed to happen it usually does on the first leg of my road dawg tour click on road dawg i stayed with my good friend alex janet leist and their wonderful children over the five days i stayed at their house alex and i listened to a lot of music and one of the guys we both liked was sunny jim i bought one of james cds from alex and fell in love with it immediately the cd was his second called life in the laid back lane little did i know that i would meet up with james and his roady shady floyd several times over the next six months james was embarking on his first real tour of the us since he moved down island almost twelve years ago we got several chances to talk over the summer and we will have an in depth article about this expatriate soon on the expatriate zone web site be sure to watch for it in the meantime here are a couple of quick things i learned about this great musician when i asked him about his expatriate status his reply was technically an expatriate is someone who lives outside their own country for whatever reason for some it s legal reasons others just because they want to or that s where the work is i have been an expatriate for nearly twelve years now i have pretty fully lived the whole caribbean experience from climbing the coconut trees and spear fishing to sailing scuba diving hot afternoons on the beach and romantic moonlit nights under the swaying palms even as james is about to repatriate himself and his family i ask if there were any other places he would consider living as an expatriate maybe somewhere on the coast of mexico or in a group of islands that are all within sailing distance of one another was the advice he gave until we can learn more of sunny jim s world stop by his web site at and if you don t have one of his cds including his latest release sandbar serenade for goodness sake pick one up you can also read a great interview alex conducted with james at travel into the zone some are running from the irs we strongly believe that we all have to get away from our computer screens and out into the real world as often as we can does this mean we give up one our most useful tools of communication computers heck no with laptops cell phones and gps systems we can go anywhere and still stay in touch if we feel the need but get real and throw that pager away as soon as you can we hope to keep this section current and informative hopefully hearing from those of you already living your lives in the zone helping the rest of us prepare for our getaway from the cities i m sure there are some of us that are preparing to disappear to places like costa rica where the the expatriate zone will become an important tool how would you like to check out a place to disappear to and write it off your taxes at the same time want to go down into the zone to places like the bahamas belize st croix puerto rico bonaire the dominica republic or saba want to do something for the planet work with dolphins save a coral reef or study monkeys and the rain forest at the same time well we have the answer check out these organization s web sites and then get some advice from your financial advisor on c non profit organizations depending on the tax bracket you re in uncle sam could end up paying for up to half the trip the oceanic society earthwatch institute reef the reef environmental education foundation after that all that s left is to make that plane reservation and remember no plane on sunday jimmydotcom after many delays jimmydotcom has finally gone to the printer with a due date of the middle of april i hit some bumps in the road on my way to publishing the first ever book about the parrot head phenomena but it was all worth it this book isn t about jimmy buffett it s about the effect of the internet on parrot heads for more information visit we have a complete outline of the book reviews from other parrot heads and samples of the pages on the site financial considerations have limited the first printing to copies at the present time so if your even thinking of buying a book i suggest you reserve your copy by putting your name on the reservation list you will be under no financial obligation it will simply indicate to my financial partners who aren t parrot heads just how many books we need to print do it right away because pre sales were brisk and if enough of you reserve a copy i can get the financing to expand the first printing let s show the world what parrot heads stand for by making this book a big success when i was on the bhotm tour this summer i had many people tell me they wanted to buy an extra book to give to their boss they wanted the boss to understand why getting the day off for a buffett concert is so important maybe it will help the rest of us to explain ourselves to our friends that just don t get it here s one of the latest reviews of the book from bob robinson founder president of the sandlapper phc in south carolina i had a great time with this club on the road dawg tour and shared an advance copy with his club when we received jackson s plea for pictures our members were blown away we hustled up a package of pix as did a majority of the parrot head clubs from around the globe and the result is pure parrothedonistic pleasure this collection is bound for glory in the annals of island time if moderation is your key to life then stay away from jimmydotcom cause this book is packed with those stories only we can tell congratulations bubbafreak bobrob sandlapper phc club trini update speaking of expatriates how about the guys who play the true music of the zone club trini s long awaited live cd will finally be coming out this april one year after it s recording jimmy has been keeping mike and robert pretty busy so it s understandable that it took awhile it will be the third in the margaritaville cafe late nite series i can t wait to hear it as my wife and i were some of the lucky ones who were in new orleans when it was recorded you can get a look at all the songs included on the new cd at club trini s revamped web site at along with the great songs we ve become accustomed to are a few i m pretty excited about if you haven t heard ct s version of african friend you re in for a real treat along with that is a song that tina and nadirah have been treating audiences to this past summer cario and bob marley s no woman no cry at the new web site fans can now order their favorite club trini cds using their credit cards so there s no excuse to not owning everything available i think a true expatriate musical library is incomplete without club trini this summer helen hiatt jimmy and the coral reefer s wardrobe designer came up with a shirt that club trini members lovingly call the ice cream vendor shirt which they wear out front at the start of the concert ok pete sometimes forgets his and when he does have it on it lost it s sleeves somewhere along the way there s a great design that has been applied to a t shirt that we all can own check it out at their site jesters and friends note card series tro pics has just released their first note cards series from their jesters and friends original oils friends places and musicians from past years have inspired these cards and parrot heads and expatriates alike will want to have these great looking cards for those times when an email just isn t personal enough the original artwork is also on sale at this site so be sure to stop by and visit them included in the jesters series are our good friends tim glancey and wally nickel millennium change bubba style i ve got to tell you i wasn t buying into this new millennium thing one bit in fact i had almost decided not to go to the buffett new year s eve show nothing to do with jimmy but i just didn t get the whole hype but at the last minute i had a change of heart and now after being a special guest at seagram s party honoring the new margaritaville tequila i m sure glad i went the shows kind of melded together for me making the millennium change over very special if you want to hear more about this or see some pictures of both visit our new the expatriate zone web site at and go to the web version of this newsletter flash expatriated phans spotted south of the border after making both of tropo travel s previous trips down to cobo san lucas mexico i had to miss this year s trek due to my being with the beach house on the moon tour on it s florida new orleans and houston swing as the story goes those bad boys and girls from the expatriated phan club showed up again mainly for the t shirts that said too much tequila or not quite enough on the back who are those people anyway whenever i go to their web site all of them have black bars covering their eyes if you want to see pictures of the trip or need info for down to the banana republics visit mike mclain also has some other great trips planned this year check them out speaking of tropo travel if you need a hotel room for the vegas or irvine shows and want a great deal visit there site for some great rates i m joining some of my parrot head friends at the key largo though i m kind of afraid to be in a town like vegas with sue and ponch aprea from the detroit phc i m joining a lot of my other friends i met on the road there too i hate seeing jimmy in vegas but i ve got to keep the streak alive and seeing all my parrot head friends will make it all worthwhile i hope peter mayer ends up playing there again this year and speaking of those great t shirts we have some neat shirts available at the island store they re similar to the shirt you got if you went on this year s trip except they have tropo travel s seaplane on the back and the no bad days logo on the front breast you can see a picture at parrothead pilots association here are a couple of tidbits for your airplane nuts and pilots out there a new online friend who s a medivac chopper pilot is trying to start a parrot head s pilot s association if you re interested contact dan at i also ran across a really cool page that features jimmy s hemisphere dancer including it s jamaican bullet hole ed booth jr an attorney from

subject re sitara release re changes in global due to consent to assignment changing counterparty names on sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact to any downstream processes i hope the following will give more clarification let me know if you have any questions or need more detail thanks dg sitara unify process scenario counterparty name changes on sitara deal ticket after deal had been pathed scheduled bridged back from unify impact zero impact to logistics volume management absolutely harmless settlements has process in place to eliminate issues process counterparty a in sitara changes to counterparty b ctprty a was on original path sent to pipeline the new name ctprty b does bridge over to unify ctprty a remains at the path level in unify gui display does not change ctprty b is now displayed at the deal level in unify the field is now highlighted to indicate a change occurred gui display changes only at high level not on path the scheduler has choice to repath if necessary or not re path if re pathing occurs the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path unify pushes back the deal number meter to sitara not ctprty info balancing works on deal number meter only not ctprty info the confirmation desk utilizes the information in sitara where all information is correct volume management utilizes the information in unify for pipeline tie out all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match up perfectly settlements utilizes information in unify settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts which would create two notification entries if invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty re draft would occur note there was an issues discovered on reports which it is correcting now autonoms tom s words of warning previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after deals were pathed and nominated basically it would change a key on an edi path duns number not affecting any other of the information already nominated to the pipeline if the scheduler re nominated data at the pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have no way to correct the problem in most cases the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to manually cut the original nominated volume this is not an issue with unify as explained above dave feel free to chime in if i left anything

validation group it gives them the ability to change counterparties names after bridge back impact to logistics unify if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge backed it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place one problem may be with the imbalance data sets which are not in production yet edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities especially where nominations were sent for entire month can t remember the rules on this one but i think unify does have some safe guards idiot proofs to force re pathing unify does have the ability to over ride duns numbers yet would still cause an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response what are if any impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take place prior periods re pathing i have a call into diane and dave both after speaking w them hopefully i can get a clear understanding of the true impact i am sure we ll need to put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow

the ability for you to invalidate the deal and then change the counterparty however i did add a warning message warning changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes make sure pipeline allows this change some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback i assume for the same reasons we had this rule it used to blow up our old scheduling systems pre unify some

subject fw section just so you know this is what i sent redmond about that case original message from hull bryan sent tuesday august am to redmond brian subject fw section brian this is a pretty good explanation of the case thus far commissioner wood is aware of the conflict between pg e now epgt and southern union probably because of lobbying by southern union and that is why he raised the issue southern union states in its initial brief below that it opposes the high demand rates that it says epgt proposes to charge for a service that does not incorporate the consumer protections of order no and argues that ferc should impose order no standards on pg e i was watching a video stream of the meeting and the whole discussion seemed to come out of nowhere here are the facts in this case on december pg e texas pipeline lp the predecessor to epgt texas pipeline lp filed a petition with ferc for approval of transportation rates under section along as they were required to do all intrastate pipelines that perform section service must either have their rates approved by ferc or they must charge rates that are approved by a state regulatory body for a similar service pg e s filing proposed in addition to the usual interruptible service a firm section service as well as an interruptible parking and lending service pg e also filed a revised statement of operating conditions to reflect the new services on february southern union gas company an intrastate transportation customer of pg e filed a late motion to intervene and raised issues which it stated should be addressed in a hearing pg e opposed the late intervention but ferc granted it on april pg e stated that southern union was intervening in order to gain leverage in renegotiating its contract for intrastate service southern union submitted data requests to pg e on april and april pg e attempted to get a protective order issued but ferc rejected their request a settlement conference was held on september a staff panel was convened on october in order to conduct an advisory non evidentiary proceeding for oral arguments on the issues with instructions to make recommendations to the commission within days on november ferc requested pages of additional information from pg e in order to complete the application in the proceeding which pg e provided on november th on december th pg e provided additional information in response to a ferc data request on january southern union submitted a proposed alternative to the cost of service and rate design that was filed by pg e on january el paso field services informed ferc that pg e texas pipeline lp had been acquired by el paso on december and that the name was changed to epgt texas pipeline lp on january epgt texas and southern union filed initial briefs on july epgt filed supplemental comments in response to the discussion at ferc summarized below where commissioner wood inquired about the extension of some order no and provisions to section service providers epgt stated that if ferc proceeds with this policy it should do so in a generic rulemaking and not in an individual pipeline proceeding on july southern union filed reply comments opposing epgt s supplemental comments on august epgt filed an amended statement of operating conditions which provides for electronic nominations two additional nomination cycles bumping clarified and updated credit provisions modified quality provisions to protect system integrity and more clearly defined authorized overrun service the ngpa gives ferc authority over intrastate pipeline rates for section service and requires that such service be provided on a non discriminatory basis but there is some question as to whether it gives ferc authority to require for example compliance with order nos and please let me know if this is enough detail or maybe it s more than you wanted,0

subject fw classic thoughts on texas a m fox sports show host jim rome they won t shut up they have to go on about spirit and old army and red ass and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in their urine to beat ut and blah blah blah shut up you start to get the feeling the entire school was built to spite ut forget the fact that when the texas legislature back in the s passed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a subsidiary branch of the main school university of texas that would teach agriculture and mechanics aggies love to say their school is older from where they get that i don t now the fact is the state intended a m to be a branch of ut they are like the afterbirth fromthe original creation like danny devito in twins so they apparently have this complex so much so that they must devote their entire school to trying to prove to ut that they are just as good all the while nobody at ut denies that a m is a good school yet they won t shut up so they write a fight song about texas and how they want to beat them they have a fish camp for freshman where they tell them how bad texas is and how good a m and all its traditions are it is the world s largest known case of penis envy and it is manifested in everything a m does the people at a m now we all have friends who went to a m or are at a m there are some nice people there however there is the corp east texas answer to dreams of rotc kids everywhere for every boy scout who never learned to stop playing with his gi joe toys there is the corp now forget the fact that a however nobody respects the corp i imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of the military world just because you dress like the army and try and act like the army does not make you the army people at a m don t even respect these clowns it is not cool to shave your head and dress up halloween is only supposed to be one day of the year if you want to carry guns and beat up civilians move to israel it is even less cool to slobber on somebody s daughter on national television and call it a tradition dry humping year old girls in the stands at football games is not cool not only is it not cool it should be against the law i know that in college station students are just prone to mount each other on the campus lawn or in the middle of class or anytime anything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and start sucking on her face but everywhere else in the world it is looked down upon especially if you are doing it on my tv that is why we have moved the game from thanksgiving because people across the nation were gagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game some boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight co ed during somebody s thanksgiving dinner we do not need to see burly women engaged in a suckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the clinique counter screw that forget make up it is too late for that just give them a veil t u is not funny it is not insulting it is dumb just imagine if folks from texas kept talking about m a and giggling that would not be funny in fact it would be retarded that s why ut fans don t do it please learn you want to lose the image of country bumpkins of a people fond of sheep of people that aren t stupid then quit building things that fall down quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national tv quit whooping in church quit whooping period quit putting up scoreboards for the enjoyment of dead mammals quit spending your friday nights practicing how to yell quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you re running for governor when you are filling out season ticket renewals and the form asks for your phone h w quit putting height weight just collectively stop making asses of yourselves go to east texas tour every small town and ask every red neck with a th grade education why they cheer for a m and wear maroon that is your fan base this is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid nobody cares if you think your band is better they might be louder they might march in neat little zig zags but they have no musical ability the point is nobody cares who wins halftime quit getting geeked up about marching bands i find it hard to believe you stood through your high school band s entire halftime performance and why cause nobody cared then and nobody cares now plus you can hear them fine sitting down even if you do care why is it cool all of a sudden now that you re in college men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds perhaps the only justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an anal probe oh wait i understand now dogs are not ladies they don t look or smell like ladies dogs eat their own feces and should be treated accordingly finally college station is an arm pit of a town quit pretending that it is a great college town it is a town and there is a college there that should be the end of this comparison if you feel that life doesn t get any better than the dixie chicken and enjoy being stuck in a never ending dukes of hazard episode then move there more importantly don t move to austin they are trying to create an educated technological and open minded population base austin is and will continue to be the birthplace and final resting place of all that is cool as my friend stephen johnson once said if the world were ever to get an enema college station is where you would connect the hose if you go to school at a m please don t be an aggie god bless the great state of texas brian puls software engineer lockheed martin enterprise solutions,0

subject personal contact dear sir madam you may be surprise to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally the purpose of my mail is that i am mr peter stevens the second son of dr dennis stevens who was murdered some time ago in the land dispute in zimbabwe i am writing from holland the netherlands where i am currently based as a political asylum seeker before the death of my father he took me to amsterdam in holland to deposit the sum of us m eighteen million nine hundred thousand united states dollars only in a private security and finance company may be he for saw the looming danger in zimbabwe but this money was put in a box as gemstones before it was deposited to avoid much tax and demurrage from the security company this money was initially meant to purchase new machines and chemicals for the farms and also to establish a new farm in swaziland the land problem came when the government of zimbabwe under the leadership of president robert mugabe introduced a new land use decree act that affected a lot of rich white farmers and some few blacks this resulted to the mob action and killing by zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society so to say infact a lot of people were killed in this land reform act including my father it is against this back ground that i consulted with my family to transfer this money out of holland to a foreign account since i am now staying in holland and the law of netherlands forbids a refugee asylum seeker to have such a money in an account i am therefore saddled with the responsibility by my family to seek for a genuine person with foreign account to handle this transaction i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in the netherlands because i will not like to go through the same experience in future since both countries have similar history moreover the netherlands foreign exchange does not allow such investment from asylum seekers i must let you know that this transaction is risk free if you accept to assist me and my family you will need to come to amsterdam the netherlands to open a non resident account which will aid us in the transfer of the money into any account you will provide this money is meant for investment purpose in any lucrative business of your choice i have two options of offers for your assistance you may go into partnership with me in any business you decides to invest the money on with the shearing of the profit carefully spelt out if agreed upon or you may decide to have of the total sum will be for me and my family and the remaining will be set aside for un forseen expenses that may be incurred in the cause of pursuing this transaction to a successful end you may contact me on the above medias so that i know what your decision is about this proposal please note that your field of specialization is not a hindreance to this transaction thank for your anticipated co operations peter stevens,1

bringing on bpd in production readers who have followed oil stock recommendations otcbb svse and asurf in the past have profited nicely the company tradestar corp otc tirr is a junior oil gas exploration company that specializes in re entries and offset drilling for hydrocarbons in an area said to have the largest untapped potential for natural gas in north america new prices and technologies have exponentially improved the economics and drill success rates average over tradestar corp is engaged in the low risk development of proven oil and gas properties in texas including the prolific barnett shale gas play south of ft worth the rapid oil and gas price increases and recent advances in economical drilling completion and production techniques have resulted in accelerated development activity and increased land lease values in this extremely productive area co mingling gas flow from several productive sands in each well increasing both initial and total output the opportunity to drill new offset wells where success rates are typically over using oil and gas the pay back on well re entry costs are estimated to average about months oil is currently and gas tirr s

barnett shale in central texas in the lower states with a balanced portfolio of oil gas properties an aggressive acquisition campaign experienced management team and application of cutting edge ep technologies we believe that tirr could be the next breakout stock in your investment portfolio investors have a ground floor opportunity to own a piece of a company poised to take advantage of

one for nomad in our efforts to enter the canadian market with our products via internet service providers cable companies and virtual operators the ruling permits us to enter the market with a competitive framework stated jan oliver ceo of nomad international inc the key to nomad s entry into the voip market is the ability of its products to offer services to both broadband and dial up

subject fw listed below are some guidelines for gathering the necessary information for netco contract setup so we can get as much done as possible prior to our start date i suggest each manager start making the phone calls and if necessary get others at the desk to help out again the goal is to get hard copies of the contracts in our hands for review so we can fill out all of the necessary information ahead of time take good notes on the questions that come up when speaking with the pipes we can get legal involved as needed when major issues surface please let me know if you have any further questions tks bob original message from calcagno suzanne sent wednesday january pm to superty robert subject fw hi all attached above is the master list of contracts we ll need for day of newco as the footnotes indicate we ll also need new business party id s passwords an ebb agreement for all pipes and a tpa for each edi pipe tammy i will be working on tpa s and ebb s the timing indicated assumes that we have a clear newco structure that the newco credit status has been identified and that a duns number has been established the two week estimate is built on working through the pipelines credit process as an entirely new entity and on turning the contracts through legal on each end so it may be shorter for some of the simpler agreements but in any event we should estimate at least days even for pooling agreements for the ldc s and intrastates we ll need to specifically identify what each requires as we discussed we need to call each pipeline and identify the following information pipeline contact name and number i know some of you sent me this b f but pls make sure that it s the legal regulatory contact not your business counterpart credit requirements for a new entity with an a credit rating they may just refer you to the tariff if so pls ask them for a specific site so we can do the research get a sense of the reaction of the pipe ldc regarding credit for the new entity we can set up a discussion between our legal and theirs so we can resolve those issues and move forward to contracting in the event that any of them raise the issue of paying any of the old enron bills just reiterate that we re setting up a completely new entity and give them bob s mine or jeff hodge s name to discuss the estate issues if there are different requirements for different service levels ie pooling vs it vs ft pls ask them to specify so that we can get the easier agreements in place first and get business started on the pipe we need to get a hard copy of the contract for each service level pls ask the pipe ldc to fax it over or give you a specific reference to their online tariff where we can find it once we have those together i ll run the traps with legal it would also be helpful if each desk identifies a first and second tier of priority pipes and agreement so that we can get you up and running for the first tier then work on the second i will be out of the office thursday friday but please call me on my cell phone at with any questions thanks suzanne,0

old paths that may no longer be accurate we ve seen old bad zero paths be re used accidentally on the scheduling position window is the weakest link goodbye on contract reference i know is used alot in the supply and market list nomlogic is also slated to use these contract reference fields for comments do we need it in the inventory list probably not as much as the supply and market list but i still believe it s necessary for pools and imbalance accounts on we use this functionality alot on cgas tenn trco and sab when we path one to many or many to one in chunks it does seem to go faster than one path at a time on brokered paths could really just be slammed in there no need for the extra processing that occurs for service contracts thanks original message from sullivan patti sent

pinion richard jaquet tammy superty robert pena matt cc warner john ripley brian d souza romeo rao ramesh subject path manager rewrite optimization project importance high all we re currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed going foward i would like bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers schedulers we had this approach with nomlogic and having clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely who ever you choose we would need about of their time for now later on with coordination efforts and testing it may go up to i don t see that happening for a while though the sooner we get someone to devote to this the better off we will be i expect these changes that we ll be looking into should improve performance quite a bit that being said we ve identified three items that would speed up processing the retrieval of path manager currently the path manager attempts to reuse path ids i can t think of any reason why we need to perform this extra step it runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn t find a match i know patti has mentioned this several times and i can t think of a valid reason for performing this work i talked with dave nommensen and according to him what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place from a scheduling perspective my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it if you were overpathed you d see it in the path manager either way pinion richard to restate the question for clarity in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply market and a service adds any up downstream contract information and or duns or drn override and then saves it unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted has this changed at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path activity number match for nominations texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected therefore if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify i don t think that this constant old path look up is needed kinsey lisa get rid of this the scheduling position window does anyone use this if not we ll remove the code logic that populates this window i have never seen a scheduler use this please verify pinion richard originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system autonoms so it was duplicated in unify by request it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it s use the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers lose it kinsey lisa why is this still here on the inventory pool list does anyone need to see the contarct references list again this code is called every retrieval time and doesn t appear to be used from my observations if they do need this information we could provide it but if not i d prefer to remove the functionality pinion richard this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool keep it kinsey lisa yes we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths what s the average number of paths they create at one time what about updates i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts by update i mean going to the path list and changing an upstream downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created pinion richard this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline there is no average they typically update a path with up downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however i hope this answers your question i see no change to this process at this time kinsey lisa on some pipes this function is used more than others when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible at this time i do not see a need to change this process on brokered paths do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service in other words when updating brokered arrangements we don t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated why do we do this for service is it because we have to renominate it i assume that s what it s for since we don t send brokered paths to the pipe anyway with the nomlogic implmentation two way interface we were planning on having it behave the same way as service we need this verified pinion richard we don t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path i don t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time kinsey lisa agree with richard,0
